      <description>Topological classification of surfaces Dimension/connectedness.
Additional structure: smoothness and manifolds.
It can be shown that every surface is a smooth 2-manifold and that every smooth 2-manifold can be embedded in \(\mathbb{R}^4\) .
Orientability.
All orientable surfaces can be embedded in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) . There are nonorientable surfaces, such as \(\mathbb{RP}^2\) (or the Klein bottle), that canâ€™t be embedded in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) .
Genus.
Triangulation \(\rightarrow\) cell complexes \(\rightarrow\) normal form.
Describe the fundamental group of a connected compact orientable surface.</description>

      <description>Curves and genus We are working with complex projective curves.
Show elliptic curves have genus 1.
Show genus 1 curves are elliptic curves.
Algebraic object Let \(C,D\) be two smooth conics in \(\mathbb{CP}^2\) , with \(\#(C\cap D)=4\) . Let \(D^*\) be the dual curve, i.e. lines that are tangent to \(D\) . Show \(D^*\) is also a smooth conic.
Define \(E(C, D)\stackrel{\triangle}{=}\{(P, L)\mid P\in C, L\in D^*, P\in L\}\subset C \times D^*\) .</description>

      <description>Jacobian invariant for circles Consider two circles C,C&amp;rsquo; with radii R, r. Let the distance between their centers be d. Define k as following:
$$ k^2 = \frac{4dR}{\sqrt{(R+d)^2-r^2}} $$ Choose the polar coordinates with origin at the center of the circle C. Let the polar angle of a point \(P(\phi)\) on C be \(2\phi\) . Let \(P_0=P(\phi_0)\) and \(P_1=P(\phi_1)\) be two points on C such that the line \(P_0 P_1\) is tangent to the circle C&amp;rsquo; at the point Q.</description>

      <description>Euler/Chapple  Suppose a triangle has a circumscribed circle with radius R and an inscribed circle with radius r. The distance between the two centers is d. Prove that: \(R^2 - d^2 = 2Rr\) . Give the above result a PCT reading.  Tetragons (Fuss) \(\star\) Suppose a tetragon has both a circumscribed circle and an inscribed circle. The radii and the distance are R, r, d as before. Prove:</description>

      <title>Could it really be a sum of cube roots?</title>

      <description>In a recent ARML practice session this interesting problem came up:
$$\text{Express }\sqrt[3]{\sqrt[3]{2}-1}\text{ as the sum of three real cube roots of rational numbers.}$$ No one was able to solve it but they did have access to Wolfram Alpha and Wolfram Alpha gave a solution! What could have motivated such a problem in the first place? Here we will attempt to reason out the solution and see if we can reverse engineer a motivation.</description>

      <description>Who we are and what we are after Or maybe we should really talk about something else more interesting. Why not just check out the math content?</description>
