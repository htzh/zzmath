      <description>PCT (Poncelet Closure Theorem) 1: Elementary considerations and Hurwitz&amp;rsquo;s algebraic correspondence Euler/Chapple  Suppose a triangle has a circumscribed circle with radius R and an inscribed circle with radius r. The distance between the two circles is d. Prove that: \(R^2 - d^2 = 2Rr\) . Give the above result a PCT reading.  Tetragons \(\star\) Suppose a tetragon has both a circumscribed circle and an inscribed circle. The radii and the distance are R, r, d as before.</description>

      <title>Could it really be a sum of cube roots?</title>

      <description>In a recent ARML practice session this interesting problem came up:
$$\text{Express }\sqrt[3]{\sqrt[3]{2}-1}\text{ as the sum of three real cube roots of rational numbers.}$$ No one was able to solve it but they did have access to Wolfram Alpha and Wolfram Alpha gave a solution! What could have motivated such a problem in the first place? Here we will attempt to reason out the solution and see if we can reverse engineer a motivation.</description>

      <description>Who we are and what we are after Or maybe we should really talk about something else more interesting. Why not just check out the math content?</description>
