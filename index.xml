      <description>In a recent ARML practice session this interesting problem came up:
$$\text{Express }\sqrt[3]{\sqrt[3]{2}-1}\text{ as the sum of three real cube roots of rational numbers.}$$ No one was able to solve it but they did have access to Wolfram Alpha and Wolfram Alpha gave a solution! What could have motivated such a problem in the first place? Here we will attempt to reason out the solution and see if we can reverse engineer a motivation.</description>

      <description>Who we are and what we are after Or maybe we should really talk about something else more interesting. Why not just check out the math content?</description>
